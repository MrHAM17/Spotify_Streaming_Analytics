# Spotify Streaming Analytics üéßüìà

This repository contains the complete project for **Spotify Streaming Analytics** developed as part of the **Lab Project work for Big Data Analytics (Semester VI)**.

The repository is centered around analyzing the **Top 200** and **Viral 50** Spotify charts across the years **2019, 2020, and 2021**, uncovering deep insights into music consumption patterns, top artists, top songs, regional engagement, chart trends, and global listening habits, through **data analysis and visualization using R programming language**.

Below, point-by-point complete detailed information is discussed.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

The digital music revolution has changed the way we listen to and consume music globally. Platforms like **Spotify** have become dominant forces in the entertainment industry, influencing listener behavior, artist strategies, and music trends.

The **Spotify Streaming Analytics** project was developed to analyze **global daily streaming charts** to discover patterns, trends, and insights from millions of records. The data collected spans three significant years (2019‚Äì2021), covering the pre-pandemic, during pandemic, and recovery phases, offering a rich dataset for exploration.

The core idea behind this project was to:

- Understand the **year-over-year growth** in music streaming.  
- Identify **top-performing artists and songs** globally.  
- Analyze **regional differences** in music consumption.  
- Explore **chart dynamics** (new entries, moves up, moves down).  
- Visualize the **global spread** of music streams geographically.

Using the R programming language and its rich ecosystem of packages, the project builds comprehensive, professional-quality plots and dashboards, enabling a clear view of the changing landscape of music streaming.

## Chapter 2: Motivation and Problem Statement

### 2.1 Motivation

With the explosive growth of Spotify, billions of streams are generated daily across the world. However, **raw charts** or **summary reports** often fail to reveal deeper patterns such as:

- How does streaming behavior vary across regions?
- What is the typical lifecycle of a new chart entry?
- How did events like the COVID-19 pandemic impact streaming volumes?
- Which countries show the highest per-user streaming activity?

There was a clear need to **systematically explore**, **analyze**, and **visualize** this data to find meaningful insights beyond basic leaderboard statistics.

### 2.2 Problem Statement

> **"To perform comprehensive time-series, categorical, and geospatial analysis on Spotify‚Äôs Top 200 and Viral 50 datasets for the years 2019-2021, uncovering trends in music consumption, regional engagement, and chart dynamics, using Big Data Analytics techniques."**

## Chapter 3: Objectives and Scope

### 3.1 Objectives

- Analyze **temporal trends** in global music streaming.  
- Identify and rank **top 10 artists** and **top 10 songs** by streams.  
- Explore **regional differences** in total and average streams.  
- Understand **chart movement** patterns (`MOVE_UP`, `NEW_ENTRY`, etc.).  
- Visualize **global engagement** using geospatial maps.
- Derive **meaningful insights** to assist industry stakeholders.

### 3.2 Scope

- Data limited to **Spotify Top 200** and **Viral 50** charts.
- Years covered: **2019‚Äì2020‚Äì2021**.
- Global perspective covering **all Spotify-supported countries**.
- Analysis performed using **R** and **open-source libraries**.

---

## Chapter 4: Literature Survey

Previous studies on music streaming analytics often focus on **short-term** datasets or **single-region** behavior. 

This project extends the scope by:

- Covering a **three-year timeline**.
- Including **global regional diversity**.
- Using **heatmaps** and **geospatial visualization** for better interpretability.

Key references include Kaggle‚Äôs Spotify datasets and academic papers related to **Big Data Analytics in Music Streaming**.
